I am a student who have strong belief in the beauty, and also the future, future of technology.
I spend most of my time working on my macbook. I love NodeJS & Javascript, and it's miraculous development. I currently working on ReactJS and React Native, two most awesome things I was experienced in the last couple years. Hopefully I can startup something good using these knowledge. I also create some graphic (poster, UI design, video motion, etc. ) stuffs freelance-ly.
My dream is making the world better.
