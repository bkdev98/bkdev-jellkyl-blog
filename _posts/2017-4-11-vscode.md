<h3>Introduction</h3>

I was used Atom for two year. Almost everything about this text editor was perfect for me. For starters, the packages manager was much more beginner friendly than Sublime. Also, as an opensource software having big community, the updates, patches and new features came very often which seem to make it more and more powerful. But 4 months ago I started to feel the pain of the slow speed of Atom. This nearly broke my heart as I had put so much time and effort customizing the perfect setup for my needs. I built custom themes, packages, created color syntax for different languages and even made my own code snippets.

I found [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) on a blog post on Medium and yes, I wasn’t sold the first time I saw it.

<blockquote>I don’t like Microsoft products, but this one had something I really expected.</blockquote>

<h5>Fast</h5>

Open VSC took me less than 5 seconds.

<h5>CPU</h5>

VSC took almost no CPU! I got some weird stuff with code helper in the activity monitor of my Mac but I quickly resolved the issue by tweakng the settings (I’ll show these magic settings at the end of this post).

<h5>Intelisense</h5>

The Atom JavaScript autocomplete was really great but when I switched to VSC I never missed it. The fact than you can mouse over a function and see what it does or cmd + click on a file path and go right to the file is awesome! You can do the same thing in Atom. I know. But it’s just not as smooth as VSC.

<h5>Packages</h5>

Like Atom, VSC has a lot of [packages](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/VSCode). The VSC community put a lot of effort into making your experience with this text editor better everyday. I miss some of Atom packages but at the same time, I have some new favorites for VSC.

<h5>My favorite packages</h5>

You can click on the package name, this is the link.

[Path Intelisense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=christian-kohler.path-intellisense)

This helps you get the relative path of your file and help you to autocomplete path names when you do something like…

<pre><code>import MyComponent from './src/components/MyComponent';</code></pre>

Plus, this works with dependencies from your packages.json.

[Auto Rename Tag](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.auto-rename-tag)

This one doesn’t do much. But what it does do is a huge help! For example, you’re working on a React project and you want to change your component MyApp to be YourApp. This extension will rename rename every ‘MyApp’ to ‘YourApp’ at the same time.

[Auto Close Tag](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.auto-close-tag)

Just good as the one above. They are the best :D

[Beautify](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HookyQR.beautify)

I am a guy who have strong belief in the beauty and this extension is beauty even more than I expected!

[JavaScript (ES6) code snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=xabikos.JavaScriptSnippets)

Some es6 snippets you help you write code faster.

[Output Colorizer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=IBM.output-colorizer)

Add color to the internal terminal. Did I mention there is a built in terminal in VSC?!?

[Babel ES6/ES7](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dzannotti.vscode-babel-coloring)

You need this if you work with React.

[Color Highlight](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=naumovs.color-highlight)

This will highlight your color variables inside CSS and JS. So, when you type something like #fff you’ll see a white colored highlight on it.

[EditorConfig](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig)

This tool makes your code more consistent for multiple users. What do I mean by this? It allows you to not worry so much about your Text Editor settings and will add some handy settings like <code>indentation</code> or <code>trim whitespace</code>. This is useful for teams because it can be painful to see some 4 space indents on one page and 2 space indents on another. This works on almost every code editor too, so if your friends don’t use want to use your new favorite text editor, it will work for them too.

[EditorConfig Generator](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nepaul.editorconfiggenerator)

This will generate a <code>.editorConfig</code> file for you with some nice editor settings.

[Eslint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)

Again, this is a tool I use on every project. This tool will help you to make your code better and let you know about errors before your code runs. For example, eslint will show you when you miss a semicolon or when you declare a variable but you never use it. But these errors depend on your eslint config.

PS I have created my own. You can install it from npm <code>npm i -D eslint-config-bkdev<code>. This one is an extension of the Airbnb linter.

[Flow Ide](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=gcazaciuc.vscode-flow-ide)

If you are like me and you like Flow you need this tool. Less laggy than the nuclide one in Atom plus it’s the better solution for VSC I’ve found.

[React Native Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsmobile.vscode-react-native)

React-Native user? This tool it’s for you.

[Snippet for React native, React, Redux](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EQuimper.react-native-react-redux#review-details)

This snippet is so awesome. You won't imagine you can write code that fast!

[Wakatime](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WakaTime.vscode-wakatime)

This plugin will track your time spent in your text editor each week. It’s like a Fitbit for a programmer. It will tell you which project you spend the most time on, which language you use the most and can even keep track of goals you set during the week.
